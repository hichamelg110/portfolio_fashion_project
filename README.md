FashionStyle E-commerce Project:

Hey! This is our e-commerce project built with React. It's an online fashion store where users can browse clothes, add them to cart, save their favorites, and purchse our special fashion products as they want



What We Built

Shopping cart that shows all your items and calculates totals
Favorites system to save products you like
Product categories (Men's, Women's, Kids', etc.)
Nice-looking product cards with hover effects
Pop-up notifications when you add stuff to cart


It'll open up at http://localhost:3000



How It Works

We used React Context to manage the cart and favorites. The main components are:
Header: Navigation bar with search and cart/favorites counters
ProductCard: Shows each product with its image, price, and buttons
Cart: Where you can see what you're buying and change quantities
Favorites: Saves products you like for later



Pages

Home page: Shows featured products
Cart page: See what you're buying
Favorites: Your saved items
Category pages: Accessories, Dresses, Men's, Women's, Kids', etc.
